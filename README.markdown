# wecast.it video hls player

The wecast.it video hls player is a free to use, open source HLS video player.
Supported platforms:
- all major browsers, including Safari, Chrome, FireFox, Internet Explorer;
- Tablets, including iPad and Android 4.2+
- Smart phones, including iPhone, Android 4.2+ and Black Berry.

A release package including demo can be downloaded at [wecast.it video hls player](https://wecast.it/opensource/wecast.it-video-hls).

The package uses HTML5 when available, and includes a flash fallback for HLS based video streams. It is capable to play m3u8 based streams using h.264 video codec / AAC audio codec.

I'm happy to receive bug reports.
